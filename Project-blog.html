<p>For the last 5 years I have been a full-time writer a media organization. Like most writers, my job has been a mix of developing online content, social media management and other duties such as responding to emails, taking client's inquires, dealing with search engine optimization, and search engine marketing. Last year, I decided to take up more challenge to learn more about the web and how it works. Only that this time, I wanted to be part of women solving problems in tech.</p>

<p>I believe I am making big progress. I have been part of the live sessions and done my assignments. I hope to continue and finish excellently. By this I mean growing my skills, and my values so that I will have the opportunity to solve real problem and get to do what I enjoy not what I can endure</p>
